 How It Works:

Primary AI: It tries to use Claude AI API for intelligent, context-aware responses
Fallback AI: If the API isn't available, it uses a smart local response system that handles:

Greetings (hi, hello, hey)
Questions (anything with a "?")
Math calculations
Goodbyes
Thanks
"How are you" type questions
And general conversations!



✨ Features:

Natural Conversations: Ask anything like "tell me a joke", "what do you think about...", "help me with..."
Context Memory: Remembers your conversation
Weather: "weather in Paris"
Time Zones: "time in Tokyo"
Math: "25 + 17"
Always Responds: No matter what you type, you get an intelligent response!

🎯 Try These:

"How are you?"
"Tell me about yourself"
"What can you do?"
"What's 100 * 5?"
"Weather in London"
"Time in Dubai"
"Tell me something interesting"
"Help me with homework"
